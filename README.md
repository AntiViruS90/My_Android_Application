Hi there! 

Thank you very much for your time and attention)

It was difficult for me, because I didn't learn Kotlin and I don't know it)

But I am a developer and my job is to read and familiarize myself with documentation)
My persistence and drive is helping me in this) today finished writing an app for my son.
I learned what mobile development is all about)

The app is written in Kotlin, it is an android app for typing words which is displayed on the screen. 
Thus the child learns the correct words and reading) I have more thoughts to make this app better, to make motivation to increase the time of using the phone.

So I'll be doing new commits else soon...
